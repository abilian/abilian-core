"""
All signals used by Abilian Core.

Signals are the main tools used for decoupling applications components by
sending notifications. In short, signals allow certain senders to notify
subscribers that something happened.

Cf. http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/signals/ for detailed documentation.

The main signal is currently :obj:`activity`.
