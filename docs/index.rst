Welcome to Abilian Core's documentation.

Abilian Core is an enterprise application development platform based on the `Flask micro-framework <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, the `SQLAlchemy ORM <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_, good intentions and best practices (for some value of "best").

The full documentation is available on http://docs.abilian.com/.

It builds on powerful and well documented Python librairies, mainly:

- `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_
- `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_
- `WTForms <http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/>`_

This documentation will assume that a developer already has some knowledge of
these librairies.
