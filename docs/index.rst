Welcome to Abilian Core's documentation.

Abilian is a platform for enterprise social networking and other social
applications.

Abilian Core (the only publicly released package of the Abilian suite, so far),
is the foundation of the Abilian platform.

It builds on powerful and well documented Python librairies, so this
documentation will assume that a developer already has some knowledge of these
librairies.

The main building blocks of Abilian Core are:

- `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_
- `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_
- `WTForms <http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/>`_
